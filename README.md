### What?

* Personal blog for myself
* I do playfully think about rolling some of what I am doing here into a kind of "anti-cms" for others.
* site files for use in LAMP hosting environement. (minus the M)

### Todo / Road Map

* ~~Trim old files~~
* ~~Merge current "beta" features to "live site"~~
* ~~Fill in my own "about me"~~S
* Put up links and images in the "museum"
* Make the "links" page pretty
* Script(s) for starting and or publishing posts
* ~~Staging area for unpublished articles to be viewed~~
* ~~Gallery layout added for use in articles~~
* ~~sanitize input for potential cross site scripting~~
* remove jquery dependency?
* consider error handling of article dom loading (H1 specifically)
* make config of document root more "portable"
* explore options for basic CI/CD and tests
