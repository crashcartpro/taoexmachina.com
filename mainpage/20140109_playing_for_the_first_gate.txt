<p>A recent addition to my computer collection is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer">Tandy Color Computer.</a> It also came with a copy of the venerable Dungeons of Daggorath. This game featured prominently in a book that Samantha and I both love. So I toted it all over to her place so we could play it for Date-Night.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_of_Daggorath">Dungeons of Daggorath</a>, released in 1982, is an RPG that features a first person view and real-time fighting system. The player is charged with the dispatching of an evil wizard while navigating a maze and fighting other enemies. Input is given with typed commands like "Turn Left", "Pull Right Sword", and "Attack Right." These can be abbreviated as "P R SW" or "A R" (learning this instantly doubled my survival time.)</p>

<p>As mentioned above, this game and system were featured in the book <a href="http://readyplayerone.com/">Ready Player One</a> by Ernest Cline. In the story, the main character must win this game to open the first of three gates, marking a players progress through a bigger contest. winning the game is of course no small feat, and With my few short hours of play, I have a new found respect for anyone completing such a challenging game.</p>
