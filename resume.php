<h2><a id="about">About Me</a></h2>
<hr>
<img class="right-image" src="images/IMG_0271.JPG" width="320px" />
<p>I am Tim</p>
<p>A hacker, maker, tinkerer who is almost constantly fascinated by the world around me.  I have aspirations to be an engineer, teacher, inventor, and all-around cyberpunk wizard.</p>
<p>Born and raised in NH. Did all of my schooling at Franklin Public Schools, and participated in a large list of extracuriculars and clubs. Boy Scouts, Grange, Little Leauge, rec-center basket ball, Archery, Odysey of the Mind, Destination Imagination, Student Leadership, Drama, and Chorus.</p>
<p>I moved to the Rocket City in January 2008, and met up with an amazing group of fellow creatives and engineers at Makers Local 256. We worked on wild and crazy projects, helped teach and learn electronics, programming, and rapid prototyping. I started attending InfoSec conferences, and building on my skills and experiences.</p> 
<p>Moved again, in 2018, out to the Rockies and Denver Colorado. Furthered my carrer in web hosting, and then DevOps with a big data analytics company. Got to see the sights and travel the west, while also still keeping up with old friends and colleagues now spread across the U.S.</p>
<p>The latest big move was back across 2/3rds of the country to buy a house in Massachusetts.</p>
