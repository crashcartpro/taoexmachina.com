<h2>New DFM! Same great taste!</h2>

<p>The "Sound Producing Amplifier Module" or "S.P.A.M." is hitting that point in it's life cycle where I can't really dedicate enough time to fufil orders, and still solder them all by hand. A good problem, to be sure. So as we hop from revision 5 straight to revision 7, I'm looking towards designing for manufatuability. In the case of this amp, that means moving to mostly surface mount componenants.</p>
<p>I was mildly nervous that diferent tolerances and charicteristics of surface mount components would affect the performance of the amplifier. In retrospect, this is a silly thought, I made the careful selection of components with all the same values. So despite the packaging, nothing really changed. Still, I felt it worth compairing the new prototype with the old rev.</p>

<h2>Rediscovering an old C.U.G.</h2>
<hr>
<a href="images/8x8_vol_2_no_8.pdf"><img class="content-image" src="images/8x8_cover.png" width="320px"/></a>

<p>30 years ago today, The Terminator was #1 in the box office, Debi Nicolle Johnson graced the cover of playboy magazine, and <a href="images/8x8_vol_2_no_8.pdf">Vol.2 No.8</a> of “Eight by Eight” newsletter was published for the members of the North Alabama TI-99 Computer Users Group</p>
<p>Fast forward a few decades. After this year's retro gaming and computing night, I had a TI-99/4a and assorted peripherals donated to my collection. Digging through the boxes, what I was most impressed with finding were the documents. Next to software, original documents and writings for these old computers are to be coveted. Some previous owner of these computer had put the original users manual into a three ring binder. Nestled in that binder with the manual, were 2 years worth of xeroxed, stapled, and mailed newsletters for a local Computer Users Group.</p>
<p>User groups were and are a great way to disseminate knowledge. Sure, your computer probably came with a manual, but those barely scratch the surface. Computers books weren't as readily available at your local library. Reaching out to others, with a shared interest, was a great way to learn the ins and outs of your own machine, as well as get reviews and demos of what other hardware or software was available. People would even write in the newsletter that there seemed to be a “TI information void” before finding this user group. To this day, user groups are a fantastic way to learn about specific systems and/or softwares.</p>
<p>This now 30 year old newsletter follows the same general format found in the other 2 years of newsletters reviewed. It opens with general club reports from the Editor, President and various Committee chairs. Of particular note, this issue has a great guide on how to add a second floppy disk drive to the TI-Peripheral Expansion Unit, often refereed to as the “p-box.” This unit came with space for one drive, but many drive controller cards could support 2 drives. This required some hacking of the case and the power supply, to allow for the second drive.</p>
<p>Also of note, is the news that a major TI-99/4a peripheral manufacturer was filing for bankruptcy. Looking back from where we are now, it should be hardly surprising, as the Computer system it self was released 6 years prior, and discontinued by TI 2 years before this publication. Which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>The whole arch of these newsletters (at least Vol 2 and 3, that I have) becomes all the more interesting when we frame them with the fact that the TI-99/4a had already been discontinued, and many newer and more robust home computers were taking it's place. In February of 1985, one member even writes, thanking TI for getting out of the home computer market. Citing that the TI-99/4a and it's peripherals were now cheaper, and other companies seemed freer to create 3rd party software and hardware. It would seem to be true then, that the hay-day of the little TI-99/4a would come in this time after TI's official support.</p>

<a href="images/IMG_7381.JPG"><img class="content-image" src="images/IMG_7381_320.JPG" width="320px"/></a>

<p>Subsequent newsletters are full of tips and reviews of products that could expand your computer's memory, improve performance of core components, and squeeze every last bit out of your code. However, even with all this great information and software available, we can see the tone of the newsletters decline. Pleas for participation become more urgent and promises are made, of better things to come. On the one hand, it is claimed many times that the turn out from the North Alabama 99er's exceeds that of other user groups in the area. However, as 1985 becomes 1986, we see a lot more events that involve either other TI-99 user groups from other areas, or user groups for whole other systems. It is never really said, but I imagine that this kind of “mixing” became more important, just to keep interest going.</p>
<p>I feel this is all the more obvious when a bit of googling found me 3 more volumes, from just two months after my last hard-copy newsletter. It seemed like the club had imploded. First, Wanda was no longer editor, Then the same woman who had stepped in as editor, helped fill the role of president. Entire committees were no longer mentioned, and others seemed to be doing double-duty. The actual colapse of the group is only speculation on my part. But the evidence of drama was clear, and many members may have finally lost interest and/or upgraded away from their venerable TI-99/4a.</p> 
<p>I will say that, upon finding this kind of treasure, I was thrilled by the fount of knowledge present. The people and the drama were of little interest to me. However, as I read and studied more of these newsletters, it is the human side of things that I find requires more rumination. To see people drawn together into a community based on shared interest, is something humans have done before, and are still doing. So while preserving the machines themselves is a fun technical problem. I would say that it is also the words and ideas, expressed by these early computer hackers, that are to be coveted.</p>

<h2>You never forget your first</h2>
<hr>
<a href="images/rcm-028.jpg"><img class="content-image"

<p>Or do you?</p>

<p>I have very strong memories of my first personal computer. I was about 6 years old and it was an Ericsson PC. This was an IBM-XT clone with an Intel 8088 processor and an amber screen. First, it was in the family office, and later in my room when my dad got something newer. First learning how to use a computer was such a formative experience in my life that I knew I would never forget it.</p>  

<p>However, as I get older and I find myself talking with younger computer geeks, I feel like I have noticed a trend; the question, "What was your first computer?" often eludes younger people. Young people with a passion for computers. Young people working in Information Technology jobs. More often than not, they have a vague memory of their first computer. "Some beige-box" or "It was a Dell something or other." are answers I've heard, while performing my very amateur study. So what's going on here? Is their ability to remember getting worse? Is their first experience with a computer truly less magical? Is it just kids these days!?</p>

<p>Well, I discussed this phenomenon with colleagues, and have found a few good ways to explain the trend I'm seeing. To start, I do think people who got their first personal computer in the early to mid 80's have a lot less to remember. There were fewer options and fewer models. So you could tell me that your first computer was a TI-99/4A and I'll know exactly the computer your talking about. But just telling me that you owned a Dell in the late 90's, doesn't tell me much about what hardware was in it, or what software it was running. And it would be a bit unreasonable of me to expect you to remember some esoteric model number, etc.</p>

<p>The other point I'm willing to concede is that the Personal Computer had become increasingly more common in the home all through the 90's. People born in 1990 or later have a much better chance of growing up with a computer already in the home. They were barely cognizant when they truly <em>first</em> saw a computer. So even if they fell in love with computing later, they are unable to recall all the details of the first. You could ask folks in my own generation to try and recall their first color TV, and you'd get a similar response; even though the color TV was just as transformative an addition to the home for the generation before.</p>

<p>So while I might feel shocked when younger computer geeks don't have magical memories of their first computer, I can understand the reasons. Memory from early childhood is frequently fragile, the Personal Computer has become nearly ubiquitous, and available models and options continue to increase every year. Not remembering their first computer doesn't negate their love of computers, it just shows their age, in a way. It's worth pointing out that there will even still be outliers to this, who DO have some great stories of their first computer. </p>

<h2>Playing for the first gate</h2>
<hr>
<a href="images/first_gate.jpg"><img class="content-image"

<p>A recent addition to my computer collection is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer">Tandy Color Computer.</a> It also came with a copy of the venerable Dungeons of Daggorath. This game featured prominently in a book that Samantha and I both love. So I toted it all over to her place so we could play it for Date-Night.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_of_Daggorath">Dungeons of Daggorath</a>, released in 1982, is an RPG that features a first person view and real-time fighting system. The player is charged with the dispatching of an evil wizard while navigating a maze and fighting other enemies. Input is given with typed commands like "Turn Left", "Pull Right Sword", and "Attack Right." These can be abbreviated as "P R SW" or "A R" (learning this instantly doubled my survival time.)</p>

<p>As mentioned above, this game and system were featured in the book <a href="http://readyplayerone.com/">Ready Player One</a> by Ernest Cline. In the story, the main character must win this game to open the first of three gates, marking a players progress through a bigger contest. winning the game is of course no small feat, and With my few short hours of play, I have a new found respect for anyone completing such a challenging game.</p>

<h2>Not invented here</h2>
<hr>
<img class="content-image" src="images/NotMadeHere.png" />
<p>Two big questions to ask as you begin any journey are: 
"Where do you want to be?" and 
"How are you going to get there" 
Before even starting a project, it's good to know what it's going to look like when you're finished, and what tools are you going to use make it. 
I have a vision of what I want my web site to look like, but a daunting number of tools to choose from.</p>

<p>Wordpress, Twitter Bootstrap, Django, 960 Grid, Wikimedia, just to name a few.
They all would give me a powerful set of tools and features. If I use one of
these frameworks, and bend it to my will, I can claim some flexibility and
proficiency in learning to use a new tool.</p> 

<p>However, even though many of these frameworks are, in some ways, just a collection of
pre-made CSS and Java Scripts, it still has it's own conventions. 
A language of their own.
Many of these frameworks are like this. 
"oh great, ANOTHER thing to learn before doing this." 
It's also easy to see some frameworks as rather bloated for my little blog, if I'm not using half the features.</p>

<p>If I re-invent the wheel, I'm being "stubborn", or maybe even projecting that I "don't play well with others." 
However, I also show that I am able to build a wheel. 
I like to learn and explore systems back to first principles.
I've enjoyed learning bits of Latin and German, and seeing how they apply to the English that I speak. 
Some people overlook it, but I think that a high-level programmer should understand at least some of the Assembly code underlying their computer systems. 
In this way, I'm already eagerly teaching myself HTML5, CSS3, MySql, and PHP for building and serving web sites.

<p>I'm still a bit undecided on this subject. Perhaps the best part about running this site myself, is I can change my mind later. 
Tao Ex Machina went live (as it were) with just some static HTML and CSS. I'm currently expeimenting with providing some back-end features with PHP. In another year, who can say?</p>

<h2>Adventures in CSS and reactive design</h2>
<hr>
<a href="images/IMG_6427_e.jpg"><img class="content-image" src="images/IMG_6427_e_320.jpg" width="320px" height="240px"/></a>
<p>CSS is supposed to make coding web pages easier and more flexible,<br/>but sometimes it behaves in unexpected ways.</p>
<p> When starting this page, I wanted to practice more contemporary web design. More HTML5 and CSS3 with less tables and dancing gifs. Looking at a number of examples, I decided I wanted a site that follows 960-width design on a large screen, and still adapts to mobile devices, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Many design sites stated that all I would need is a <code>float:left;</code> and a handful of <code>div</code> containers. But things seemd to slide around the page without rhyme or reason. A floated image would leave the bounds of it's own div. Text slides up under it. Then the browser just sits there and laughs at you when you want to center something horizontally AND vertically.</p>
<p>However, perseverance is rewarding. I read more documents, look at more examples, try 50 different things, asked a few friends, and finally find a solution. Primarily hinged on giving the #logo and #title <code>display:inline-block;</code> and containing div gets <code>overflow:auto;</code>. Now both elements in my title-bar behave partly as an inline element and partly as a block element. They will sit next to each other vertically, but also drop a line if there isn't room for the element. And as long as the wrapper around those elements doesn't have a defined height or width, setting <code>overflow:auto;</code> seems to let it adjust to the height and margins of the containing elements.</p>
<p>Trying to center the title didn't help either. Here I did make a couple concession. Fist, setting BOTH the #logo and the #title to <code>vertical-align:middle;</code> seems an easy enough way to vertically center both elements together. The image is basically setting the bar for the text. But I could never get the title to exactly center itself horizontally while the logo sat there on the left. SO what you see is really just a trick of margins. setting the left side to a relative value. (14% looked good enough to me.)</p>
<p>Lastly, actually adjusting the horizontal center of the logo and the title when on something like a mobile device is really just a trick of the code, defining some alternate CSS based on the browser width. CSS has a built in function for this that I used: <code>@media screen and (max-width: 600px)</code> The CSS tags defined after this only apply if the browser is LESS than 600px. (This value works well on my DROID 4, but might need to be adjusted for iPhone4S and newer) The only CSS attributes defined differently in this block are: <code>display:block;</code> and <code>margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;</code> for both my logo and title elements.</p>
<p>Et voilà, My page adjusts just how I felt it should Thanks for the tips: Barbra, David, Jesse, and Charlotte.</p>
